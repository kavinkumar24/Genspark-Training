## Authentication: 
The process of verifying a user's identity to confirm their identity for claiming resource.

## JWT and its structure: 
A JSON Web Token is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties, structured as a header, payload, and signature.

## Automapper: 
A convention-based object-to-object mapper that automates the transformation of data between different types.

## Token Generation: 
The process of creating a unique, often encrypted, string (token) to represent a user's authenticated session or authorization.

## Authentication enabling in Swagger: 
Configuring Swagger/OpenAPI UI to allow users to provide authentication tokens (like JWTs) to authorize requests for API endpoints.
