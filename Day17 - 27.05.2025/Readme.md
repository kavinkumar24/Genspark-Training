## Navigation Properties 

Properties in entity classes that represent relationships to other entities in the object model.

## ORM

A technique for mapping database tables to programming language objects, enabling database access through object-oriented code.

## DB context

A central class in Entity Framework that manages database connections and provides access to entities mapped to tables.

## Entity Frameworks usage

Used to perform data access in .NET applications by managing models, queries, relationships, and migrations with minimal SQL.

## migrations

A version-controlled process for updating the database schema in sync with changes in the applicationâ€™s data models.

## Connection to postgres

Configured using UseNpgsql in the database context options to establish communication with a PostgreSQL database.


Data annotations like [ForeignKey] and [InverseProperty] define how entity relationships are mapped and linked in the database.
