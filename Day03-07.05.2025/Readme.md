## Stored Procedure

- By using the stored procedure we can improve the compiling of the code
- It helps to make a `Pre-complied` code

### Benefits

- Improve Performance
- Make more secure (Avoid SQL Injection)
- Reducing complexity

### Types of Parameter

- In Parameter - passing input as a params
- Out Parameter - getting result from the procedures

#### In SQl variable names preceded with `@` symbol


## JSON methods

- `JSON_QUERY` - extract data from a JSON object
- `JSON_MODIFY()` -  used to update the JSON string
- `JSON_VALUE` - extracts a scalar value from a JSON string
