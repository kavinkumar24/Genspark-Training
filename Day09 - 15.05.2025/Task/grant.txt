-- Grant privileges steps

-- 1. Run a Primary Server with the port of 5433
pg_ctl -D D:\pri -o "-p 5433" -l d:\pri\logfile start

-- 2. Log into the Primary Server
psql -p 5433 -d postgres

-- 3. Create a new role for read-only access
CREATE ROLE readonly WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '123';

-- 4. Create a new database
CREATE DATABASE sample_db;

-- 5. Grant CONNECT privileges on the database to the readonly role
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE sample_db TO readonly;

-- 6. Make all tables in the public schema owned by the readonly role
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO readonly;

-- 6. connect to postgres database
psql -p 5433 -p 5433 -d postgres
 
 and verify the privileges

-- 7. Connect to the sample_db database
psql -p 5433 -d sample_db

-- 8. Create a new table
CREATE TABLE test_table (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);
-- It says that the role does not have permission to create a table
