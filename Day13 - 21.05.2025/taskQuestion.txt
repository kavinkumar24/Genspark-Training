Design a simple console-based application to manage appointments for a cardiologist. The application should allow:

Adding a new appointment (Patient info, Appointment date/time, Reason for visit)

Searching existing appointments based on filters such as:

Patient Name (contains)

Appointment Date (exact match)

Patient Age (range)

This is intended for internal use by the doctor's clinic staff to quickly find upcoming or past appointments.
