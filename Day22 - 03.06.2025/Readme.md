- Policy based Authorization 
- Task based on the policy based authorization

## Role-based Authorization: 
Grants or denies access to resources based on predefined roles assigned to users, such as "Patient," "Doctor," or "Guest."

## Unit Testing With AAA rule:
 A structured approach to writing unit tests where each test is organized into three phases: Arrange (setup), Act (execute), and Assert (verify the outcome).

## In-memory Database:
 A database that stores data primarily in the computer's RAM, offering very fast data access and often used for testing or transient data. (only contains schema)

## Policy-based Authorization: 
Grants or denies access to resources based on evaluating specific custom rules and conditions defined in policies, offering more granular control than roles alone.
