## Mocking: 
In unit testing, creating simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real dependencies, allowing isolated testing of a specific code unit.

## Uses of mocking: 
To isolate the unit under test from external dependencies, control their behavior, and verify interactions, especially in unit testing scenarios.

## Log4Net: 
A popular, flexible logging framework for .NET applications used to output log statements to various destinations like files, databases, or the console.

## Custom Exception Filter: 
A .NET mechanism (often used in ASP.NET Core MVC) that allows developers to centrally catch and handle exceptions that occur during action execution, providing a consistent way to manage errors and responses.
